Novato Police Department,Marin,,2019-11-15 12:56:00,"This incident occurred in July, 2019. The suspect a BMA approached the victim in Novato on First St at Grant Ave. The BMA Suspect pointed a dark colored pistol at the victims face and forcibly stole the victim's purse and fled the scene in a newer blue Volkswagon Tiguan. Shortly after the robbery, the suspect used the victim's credit cards at a KFC located in Oakland. A Google Geo-Fence warrant was granted by a judge and executed to trace any cell data where the original crime occurred (First St and Grant Ave) and also at KFC in Oakland (3400 Foothill Blvd) in an attempt to locate the same device at both areas. In November, 2019 I received  Device ID information from Google which did not appear to be a match to the suspect. There is no date of births or addresses for the Device ID individual's and therefore I am unable to send hard copy letters. Therefore, I ultimately utilized CLEW to upload the data.
