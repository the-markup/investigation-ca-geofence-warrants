"California Highway Patrol","Kings","20-059A","03/12/2020 - 19:14","On February 23rd, 2020, I was on routine patrol as Unit B88-003, in full California Highway Patrol (CHP) tan uniform, driving a fully marked black and white CHP patrol vehicle, license plate number 1501466, which is equipped with an audible siren and at least one lighted steady red lamp visible from the front.  At approximately 2113 hours, I was traveling northbound on Interstate 5, south of Quebec Avenue, monitoring radio traffic, when I was dispatched by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) Fresno Communications Center (FCC) to a possible hit and run traffic collision that occurred on the Avenal Cutoff Road, near Nevada Avenue.  Dispatch advised the victim was standing by in a tan Dodge Caravan, on the Avenal Cutoff Road, south of Gale Avenue, and the subject vehicle, described as black Honda Accord with driver side damage, had fled northbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road.  I acknowledged the radio traffic and began to respond to the victim’s location.  While responding, dispatch advised the reporting party, later identified as Alberto Ruiz Jr. (CDL: D7874178 DOB: 10/23/1986), had informed them the subject vehicle had passed them and was now traveling southbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road.  I acknowledged the update and responded to the Avenal Cutoff Road and State Route 269, which is an area just south of the last known location of the subject vehicle.

At approximately 2122 hours, I was executing a right turn from northbound State Route 269 to northbound Avenal Cutoff Road, when I observed an older model black Honda Accord (Subject Vehicle) with damage to the left rear fender and bumper, traveling southbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road, approaching the fully marked and posted stop sign with State Route 269.  As I completed the right turn, I used the patrol vehicle’s driver spotlight to illuminate the driver side and interior of the subject vehicle.  I slowed to less than 5 MPH as I became adjacent to the subject vehicle and observed the driver (Subject) was a Hispanic male adult in his late 20’s or early 30’s with a thin build and was wearing a lighter colored button up shirt.  I executed a U-turn and positioned the patrol vehicle to the rear of the subject vehicle, a black 2003 Honda Accord bearing California license plate number 7MEY780.  I activated the patrol vehicle’s forward red lights and initiated an enforcement stop as the subject vehicle executed a left turn from southbound State Route 269 to southbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road.  I advised dispatch I had located a vehicle matching the description provided by the reporting party and requested a registration and wants check using the California license plate number on the rear of the subject vehicle.  Dispatch advised the registration check returned with no wants to a 2003 Honda four door, registered to Javier Salgado Garcia or Lorena Herrera Espinosa at an address of 125 West Stanislaus Street, Avenal, CA 93204.

The driver of the subject vehicle momentarily yielded to the right shoulder of State Route 269, south of the Avenal Cutoff Road, before subsequently fleeing the enforcement stop, traveling southbound on State Route 269.  I activated the patrol vehicle’s audible siren, initiated a pursuit, and advised the Fresno Communications Center of the updated situation.  Despite my patrol vehicle’s forward red lights and audible siren activated, the driver of the subject vehicle continued to aggressively flee southbound on State Route 269 at speeds in excess of 100 MPH, while passing other uninvolved vehicles over solid yellow lines, a violation of section 2800.2(a) of the California Vehicle Code.  I continued to actively pursue the subject vehicle until we reached the intersection of State Route 269 and Hydril Road, where the subject vehicle drove over an elevated asphalt curb, through a drainage ditch, and continued westbound through the hills along the northwest edge of Avenal.  I advised dispatch I was unable to continue the pursuit due to the terrain and requested responding units to establish a perimeter while we waited for CHP Unit CE-H40, a Departmental police helicopter flown by Officer T. Blasingame, #17510, with flight observer Officer D. Henschel, #20808, to arrive overhead.  After arriving on scene, Officer Henschel located the subject vehicle due north of the Avenal High School Football Field.  CHP Unit B88-002 (Officer C. Ripley) and officers with the Avenal Police Department responded to the subject vehicle and discovered it had been abandoned.  After an exhaustive search of the surrounding areas, CE-H40 was unable to locate the driver of the subject vehicle and our perimeter was called off.  Officer Ripley requested a tow truck for the subject vehicle and later completed an inventory and CHP 180 to store the vehicle under section 22651(b) of the California Vehicle Code.  J and D Towing responded to the scene and would later tow and store the subject vehicle at the tow yard located at 1209 Milham Avenue, Kettleman City, California 93239.  I later contacted Officer Ripley who related to me the following: During the inventory of the subject vehicle, Officer Ripley discovered a blue and black cellular phone in the subject vehicle’s center console, that was later identified as an Axia Model: QS5509A Serial Number: 357485095454858.  Officer Ripley heard the phone ring through the subject vehicle’s speakers and realized that the cellular phone was connected to the subject vehicle through a Bluetooth adapter.  Officer Ripley retrieved the cellular phone which he kept in his possession until he handed it to me, and I booked it into evidence at the California Highway Patrol Coalinga Area Officer under evidence number: E20200014.

As Officer Ripley conducted the vehicle inventory, I responded to the reporting party of the possible hit and run, who was still standing by on the Avenal Cutoff Road, south of Gale Avenue.  Upon my arrival, I contacted the reporting party, who was identified by his California photo driver license as Alberto Ruiz Jr. (CDL: D7874178 DOB: 10/23/1986).  Alberto Ruiz Jr. related in essence the following: Alberto Ruiz Jr. was driving a silver 2010 Toyota Corolla bearing California license plate number 7BRY112 northbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road, south of Nevada Avenue, following his mother, later identified as Martha Delia Lopez (CDL: C0297658 DOB: 09/09/1961), who was driving a tan 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan bearing California license plate number 8ELA801.  As they traveled northbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road, Alberto Ruiz Jr. observed the subject vehicle, he described as a black Honda Accord, parked in the open dirt field, near the orchard, off the east shoulder of the Avenal Cutoff Road.  As Alberto Ruiz Jr. and Lopez drove past the subject vehicle, the driver suddenly accelerated from the field, entered the northbound lane of the Avenal Cutoff Road, and began to overtake the two vehicles.  The subject vehicle moved into the opposing lane of traffic and aggressively passed both the Dodge and Toyota before reentering the northbound lane directly in front of Lopez.  After reentering the northbound lane, the driver of the subject vehicle suddenly “slammed” on the brakes for no obvious reason in what Alberto Ruiz Jr. described as an attempt to “brake check” Lopez.  Lopez and Ruiz were able to adequately adjust their speed and they continued to follow the subject vehicle.  The driver of the subject vehicle continued to slow until all three vehicles were traveling at approximately 10 MPH.  As the vehicles approached the intersection with Nevada Avenue, Alberto Ruiz Jr. moved into the number two lane and attempted to pass the subject vehicle.  As Alberto Ruiz Jr. became adjacent to the subject vehicle, the driver of the subject vehicle suddenly steered to the right and began to force Alberto Ruiz Jr. off the road.  The subject vehicle continued to aggressively steer/veer into Alberto Ruiz Jr. until the two vehicles reached the tree line of an orchard, where Alberto Ruiz Jr. was forced to stop to avoid colliding with the subject vehicle or the trees.
As the two vehicles came to a stop, Lopez drove the Dodge off the road and came to a stop off the east shoulder, to the left rear of both vehicles.  The driver of the subject vehicle exited and began to approach Alberto Ruiz Jr. who placed the Toyota in reverse and began to back away from the confrontation.  Alberto Ruiz Jr. described the driver as a Hispanic male adult in his 20’s, near six feet tall, with a thin build, wearing blue jeans and an unknown colored shirt.  As Alberto Ruiz Jr. backed away, the driver reentered the subject vehicle, placed it in reverse, and accelerated quickly, intentionally ramming the right front of the Dodge with the left rear of the subject vehicle.  After striking the Dodge, the driver of the subject vehicle fled the scene northbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road, at a high rate of speed.  Alberto Ruiz Jr. contacted emergency dispatchers and notified them of the collision.  While on the phone with dispatchers, Alberto Ruiz Jr. observed the subject vehicle pass them in the opposite direction, traveling southbound on the Avenal Cutoff Road.  Alberto Ruiz Jr. updated the dispatcher and awaited CHP arrival.

After obtaining Alberto Ruiz Jr.’s statement, I contacted his right front passenger, identified as Larissa Leann Ruiz (DOB: 04/26/2004); Lopez; and her right front passenger, identified as Luis Armando Lopez-Fierro (DOB: 08/06/1969) who all corroborated Ruiz Jr.’s statement with similar accounts.  After obtaining their statements, I formed the opinion the driver of the subject vehicle had attempted to assault Ruiz Jr. and Ruiz and had assaulted Lopez and Lopez-Fierro using the subject vehicle as a deadly weapon, a violation of section 245(a)(1) of the California Penal Code.  As the severity of the original crime had increased, I asked Officer Camara to later change the subject vehicle’s storage from section 22651(b) to section 22655.3 to ensure the vehicle was not released or accessed pending the issuance of a search warrant.","Crime of Violence","Assault"," ","Device Only"," ","Basic subscriber information from a service provider

Officers later learned that Chase had initially lied and actually found his mother deceased with a gun in her hand.

"Walnut Creek Police Department","Contra Costa"," ","02/11/2021 - 08:05","On 9/21/20 at approximately 1949 hours, WCPD officers responded to Motel 6, 2389 N. Main St., Walnut Creek, County of Contra Costa, State of California, on the report of an armed robbery that had just occurred. Per the Victim, Therel Scott, the suspects held him at gunpoint and stole his vehicle, a Mercedes S550, California license plate 6HJK405. 

Scott provided the responding officers with the following statement in summary:

Earlier in the day, Scott called a friend named Tanisha Henderson from Oakland. He has known her for several years. Scott asked Henderson if she wanted ""to fuck"" and asked her to come to Motel 6. Henderson came over to the motel later in the afternoon (unknown time). Scott asked Henderson to go get some Swisher's to bring back to the motel. 

Henderson took her car and left to get Swisher's. Approximately two hours later, she returned to the motel. She knocked at the room door. Scott walked to the door and looked through the peephole. He saw Henderson standing there, so he opened the door. As soon as Scott opened the door, he saw two black males standing on either side of the doorframe. They each pulled out handguns, pointed them at Scott and demanded he get onto the floor. 

Scott backed up a few steps into the room and got onto his stomach. Henderson sat on the ground by the door to the room. The two suspects told him to stay on the floor while they rummaged through his motel room. They then left the room and closed the door. Scott got up, looked through the peephole, and saw them get into his Mercedes and leave with it.

Scott believed Henderson set up the robbery. Not trusting Henderson, he took her cell phone. He then left the room and went to the office where he called 911.  When Scott returned to the room, Henderson was gone. Scott gave the cell phone he took from Henderson to the responding officers.  

Scott could not provide any details regarding the two suspects who held him at gunpoint.

"Walnut Creek Police Dept.","Contra Costa"," ","02/11/2021 - 12:49","On 11/14/2020 I was called by Detective Sergeant Slater to assist in the investigation of a shooting that had just occurred at Motel 6, 2389 N. Main St., Walnut Creek, Contra Costa County, State of California.  Sgt. Slater told me that officers had been dispatched to Motel 6 on 11/14/2020 at about 0940 hours for a report of a possible shooting. When officers arrived at Motel 6 they saw a subject, later identified at Nicholas Reins, walking from the rear of Motel 6 towards the front office.  Reins was limping and had a towel on his leg. Reins told the officers he had been shot by a subject he knew as “D” when “D” tried to rob him. Reins showed the officers his wounds, which appeared to be an entry and exit wound caused by a bullet, on the inner portion of his left thigh. 
The motel manager had not seen anyone leaving the motel prior to police arrival. 
I first interviewed the Victim, Nicholas Reins, who was at John Muir Hospital (JMH) being treated for two wounds to his left leg.  The wounds were not life-threatening.  I was advised by medical staff that the wounds appeared to be caused by a bullet which had gone in one wound and out the other wound.  Reins had not been given anything that would prevent him from talking to me.
Through a series of questions and answers Reins told me the following (organized, paraphrased and summarized):
He has been at the motel for 6 or 7 days.  He is there alone. He met ""D"" the second or third day he was at the motel. He first met ""D"" when he was outside of his room (118) smoking. ""D"" walked by and asked for a smoke which he gave him and they talked for a bit. ""D"" has been to his room a few times, but he never went to ""D's"" room.   He and ""D"" have also smoked some weed together. 
He described ""D"" as:
Black male with darker skin.
Short hair in twists.
Clean shaven. 
Late 20's or early 30's; (28-35).
5'09""; medium build.
Wearing a black jacket, red striped polo shirt with a collar and wearing a snapback hat backwards, and jeans.
This morning he was in his room when he heard a knock on the door at about 9:10 am. He looked out the peep hole of his door and saw it was ""D"" so he let him in. They were talking for about 20 minutes when ""D"" called someone. He heard ""D"" say something like ""It's a small world, I'm here right now too."" He hung up and told him that his friend was at the motel as well and had stayed with a girl last night. About 2 minutes later Reins heard a knock on his door and ""D"" let in his friend. He thinks ""D"" knew his friend was there all along and ""D"" brought him to help him rob Reins. 
He described ""D's"" friend as:
Black male, mixed race, lighter skin.
Dreadlocks to his shoulders.
A goatee.
Wearing: a green or brown hoody and jeans.
He and ""D"" and the friend talked for about 10 minutes when Reins got up to indicate he wanted them to leave. He needed to do his laundry. 
""D"" and his friend stood up and started to walk towards the door of his room. Their backs were to him. ""D"" turned around and pointed a gun at him and said something similar to, ""You know what time it is"" and ""run everything"". To Reins this meant that he was getting robbed. He told ""D"" something similar to, ""You're going to have to kill me"" and took a step towards ""D"". ""D"" then shot him in the leg. 
He described the gun as a camouflage green pistol.
""D"" held the gun in his right hand. He isn't sure if “D” took the gun from his waistband or his jacket pocket. He hadn't seen the gun before and didn't know ""D"" owned a gun. He had no idea why ""D"" pulled a gun on him and he was surprised by it. 
""D's"" friend never said anything to him and didn't do anything to him. 
Reins started to yell ""Get the fuck out"" over and over so that someone would come help him. He was afraid they might shoot him again. ""D"" and his friend left. He closed the door. He didn't see where they had gone. He didn't hear a car leave after the shooting. He thinks ""D"" could still be at the motel. He doesn't know what room “D” is in.  
He tried calling 911 from the room phone but it didn't work. He then got his cell phone and went into the bathroom and called his mom who didn't answer her phone. He called his grandmother who answered and he asked her to have his mom call him. His room phone then rang and he answered it. It was the front desk who asked him what happened. He told the person that he had been shot. He then waited for the police to respond before he left his room. 
He was scared of being shot again and scared that ""D"" and his friend would come back and get him. He does not know why ""D"" shot him.  It wasn't a drug rip.  He didn't have any cash on him. He doesn't have anything. He has a small safe in his room which they could have taken with them.  The safe only has paperwork. He has a lot of clothes and bags so maybe they thought he had a lot of stuff to take.  He didn’t see “D” or his friend take any of this stuff.
He doesn’t own a car and didn’t have a car at Motel 6. 
He doesn't own a gun and has never had a gun.
He wants ""D"" arrested and charged for shooting him.
END OF STATEMENT
I took photos of his wounds on his left leg. There were two wounds on his inner left thigh just above his knee. 
I provided detectives and officers who were on scene at the motel, of the above suspect descriptions.  
The motel management provided officers and detectives with the names of the guests who had rented rooms and the vehicles associated with the rooms.  Officers conducted searches via law enforcement sites for photos and physical descriptions of the guests who had rented rooms, to determine if they matched the suspect descriptions. 
Based on the suspect descriptions, it appeared the renter of room 220, Ki Hopson, matched the description of “D’s” friend. Hopson is currently on formal probation out of Solano County for VC 2800.2(A) with a search clause through 10/19/2021 (DKT #VCR229364).  It appeared the renter of room 114, Dashon Banks, matched the description of “D”.  Banks has a criminal history that includes arrests and convictions for robbery. 
Photo lineups were prepared by Detective Leonard.  Detective Lingua, who had no knowledge of the case or the suspects, came to JMH and showed the photo lineups to Reins. Reins picked out Dashon Banks (01/08/1990) as the suspect who shot him. Reins did not pick out Hopson as “D’s” friend, but chose another person’s photo who was a filler in the photo lineup.
I drove back to the station where I met with Detective Hall who was writing warrants for the motel rooms that were believed to be involved in this incident based on the information obtained from officers and detectives. The search warrant was for rooms 118, which is where the Victim Reins had stayed and where the crime occurred, and room 114, which is where Suspect Banks had stayed. She was also writing a Ramey Warrant for Dashon Banks. The Search Warrant and Ramey Warrant were signed by The Honorable Judge D. Douglas. 
The search warrant was executed with the assistance of Central County SWAT. Once the scene was cleared by SWAT, I went to Motel 6 to assist in executing the warrants and interviewing Suspect Banks. 
At Motel 6 I went into room 118 which is where Victim Reins had been staying. I saw a small safe on a shelf with its door open. I looked into the safe and saw blue pills in baggies, a green leafy substance in baggies and some bullets in a baggie. I saw an empty holster on the ground near the bed. I saw a cartridge on the floor, which was the same caliber of the bullets in the safe (9mm). There were also what appeared to be blood spots on the floor of the room.  A bullet hole was located in a small table near the bed.  The bullet was not located as it appears to have entered a wall.  No firearm was located. The Victim’s cell phone, an Apple iPhone, was seized from his room. 
Detectives searched room 114 which is where Suspect Banks had stayed.  No firearms, bullets, cartridges, and/or holsters or anything related to firearms was located in his room.  Banks’ vehicle was also searched pursuant to the Search Warrant written by Detective Hall and no firearm or firearm paraphernalia was located. 
I spoke to Dashon Banks who was handcuffed in the back of a patrol vehicle. I first read him his Miranda rights which he said he understood by saying ""yeah"" and he told me he wanted to talk to me. 
Through a series of questions and answers he told me the following (organized, paraphrased and summarized):
He and his girl have been in the motel room all day. 
He went out of the room to pay for another night when a police officer told him to go back to his room so he did. He looked on the news to see what was happening and saw that someone had been shot. 
He does not know who was shot.
He didn't hear any gun shots. 
They got to the motel last night, 11/13/2020. He didn't go anywhere this morning. His girl went to get something to eat or something like that and took his car this morning. 
He didn't leave the room to smoke, he smoked in his room. 
He doesn't know anyone staying at the motel. He didn't go to any other rooms. 
He doesn't know why someone would point at him as the shooter. He has the wrong person. 
Today he was wearing blue jeans, a red hoody with a black hoody over it. 
He doesn't know who got shot. The victim is lying. 
He goes by ""Shaun"".  Back in the day he was called ""Nose"".  No one has never called him ""D"". 
END OF STATEMENT
Detective Lingua and I checked the trash cans and the dumpsters for any evidence, but did not find anything. 
I requested a canine come to the scene and perform an article scent. Officer Ackers and his K9 Zeke checked the area, but no evidence was located.
Detective Duncan learned from the Motel 6 management that the Victim Reins had a vehicle associated with his room (CA/3XMM019).  A gold Lexus with a paper plate on the rear and no plate on the front was located in the front parking lot of Motel 6.  In the front dash window there was a Motel 6 vehicle card with the plate (CA/3XMM019) inscribed in pen. When the VIN was run it returned to a different license plate (CA/2TFB329) and the registered owner was listed as Weixiong Gan from San Francisco.  Detective Hall located the keys to the gold Lexus in Reins’ room, 118.  She had the vehicle towed to the WCPD impound lot for evidence purposes. 
I have called Reins repeatedly, but as of this time he has not returned my phone calls. 
Based on my training, education and experience, as well as my knowledge of the investigation of WCPD 20-28328, the Victim Reins was shot in room 118 due to finding probable blood drops and a bullet casing on the floor and a bullet hole in a table.  
During my initial interview of Reins he told me that he didn’t own a car, didn’t have a car at Motel 6, didn’t own a gun and the reason he was shot was not due to a narcotic exchange, but due to some unknown reason.  His statements appear to have been false due to finding illegal narcotics and bullets in a safe in his room.  A gun holster was also found in his room. Reins also registered the gold Lexus with the Motel 6 staff and the keys to the gold Lexus were found in his room. There was no one else associated with his room.  
By examining Rein’s iPhone as requested in the Affidavit, the information obtained from the iPhone may rebut the contention he has made that he was not involved in a narcotic transaction, he does not know why he was shot, and that he never had a firearm, thereby proving that he is a liar.
Based on my training, education and experience, and the aforementioned, I believe that Reins communicated with the unknown male suspects by means of electronic communication and by use of his cell phone and that the communication will be instrumental in identifying the suspects.

"Walnut Creek Police Dept.","Contra Costa"," ","03/31/2021 - 09:09","On 03/09/2021, at about 2000 hours, WCPD Officers were dispatched to 6 Scots Ct., Walnut Creek, to assist the Fire Department with a male subject who was suffering from a cardiac arrest.  Upon arrival to the residence, the officers found the Fire Department personnel and paramedics performing life saving measures on a male subject. The male subject, later identified as Alexander Amiri, who was 37 years old, was pronounced deceased at 2035 hours by paramedics.  
Because the death appeared suspicious, I was asked to come to the scene to investigate.  
When I arrived I saw the Deceased, Alexander Amiri, on his back, in the driveway of the residence, with a blanket over him. I checked his body, including his head and his hands, and did not see any signs of defensive wounds, or signs of trauma. Alexander was wearing tennis shoes, socks, beige pants and underwear. There was a jacket and a cell phone next to him.   
I saw an orange hypodermic needle cover next to Alexander's body. I was advised by both Lt. Connors and Sgt. Godinez that the orange hypodermic needle cover did not come from the paramedics who had performed life-saving measures on Alexander.  I was also advised by Hamid Amiri, Alexander’s father, that there would be no reason for Alexander to have a syringe.  
Alexander Amiri’s father, Hamid Amiri, was interviewed by me and he told me the following (organized, summarized and paraphrased);
Alexander suffered from a bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia and anxiety. He took 20 mg of Olanzapine and Aripiprazole as prescribed by his doctor. Alexander had used marijuana in the past and had tried cocaine and heroin once before. As far as he knew, Alexander had been sober of all drugs for two years. 
On 01/08/2021, Alexander was admitted to a mental health facility at Napa County Public Health. He was released on 01/28/2021 and was in good spirits. Upon his release from the hospital, Alexander stayed at 260 American Canyon Rd #46, American Canyon (property owned by Hamid) before residing with Hamid on 02/01/2021.  It was only Hamid and Alexander who lived at 6 Scots. Ct., Walnut Creek. 
Alexander was taking all of his prescribed medications and was excited for an upcoming vacation planned by Hamid.  Alexander was in good physical health and he had not had any recent medical problems. 
Within the past few weeks, Alexander re-connected with an old friend, Ryan Kastner. Hamid was not happy about Alexander hanging out with Kastner because they used to do drugs together.
On 03/09/2021 at approximately 5:30 pm, Alexander and Hamid had dinner at home. They began watching a movie, when Alexander asked Hamid if he could hang out with Ryan Kastner. Hamid told Alexander that he preferred if Kastner came to their house.  Alexander went to his room and called Kastner.  Sometime between 7:00 pm and 7:30 pm, Alexander went outside to meet Kastner.  Hamid stayed inside the house watching the movie.  At approximately 7:56 pm, Hamid missed a call from Kastner on the house land line.  He knew it was Kastner because Kastner’s phone number is programmed into the phone. At approximately 7:58 pm, Hamid called Kastner back. Kastner told Hamid that Alexander had collapsed outside, on the driveway. Hamid immediately went outside and found Alexander lying on the right side of his body with his eyes closed. He was warm to the touch, but unresponsive and not breathing. Hamid ran inside the house and called 9-1-1.  Hamid went back outside and performed CPR on Alexander until the paramedics arrived on scene and took over.  Hamid never saw Kastner. 
Hamid believes that Ryan Kastner gave Alexander drugs. Kastner knows that Alex has a mental illness. He believes that Ryan persuaded Alex to take the drugs. He doesn't know what drugs he gave Alex.
I asked Hamid if the phone lying next to Alexander was Alexander’s and he told me it was.  Hamid told me that I could take the phone and provided me with the passcode to get into the phone. 
Officers were able to locate Ryan Kastner at his residence, 1289 Avenida Sevilla, Walnut Creek, where he was detained for an unserved misdemeanor warrant for his arrest from Concord PD. 
I was advised by my supervisor that WCPD Dispatch had received a 9-1-1 call from Kastner at 1955 hours requesting an ambulance to 6 Scots Ct.  While Dispatch was transferring the call to the Fire Department, Kastner hung up.  The WCPD dispatcher was able to determine it was Ryan Kastner by checking the phone number in TLO (a law enforcement site used to search for information).
WCPD Dispatch received another 9-1-1 call from Hamid at 1959 hours. This call was transferred to the Fire Department. 
The Fire Department called WCPD Dispatch to request officers assist them on scene at 6 Scots Ct.
The Deputy from Coroner’s Office who arrived on scene was advised that I had seized as evidence Alexander’s cell phone. 
I interviewed Ryan Kastner and through a series of questions and answers Kastner told me the following (organized, summarized and paraphrased):
Today, 03/09/2021, at about 7:30 pm, when he was in Concord getting gas, he called Alexander. Alexander told him ""I'm about to do a bunch of Opana."" Alexander said ""He had just sniffed a bunch of Opana.""  He didn't know what Opana was. 
Today, 03/09/2021, he pulled up to Alexander's house around 7:30 pm and he saw Alexander lying on his side in the driveway.  He didn't get out of his car. He yelled ""Alex, Alex"".  Alexander ""didn't say nothing"".   He didn't have cell phone service there, so he drove towards Kaiser to get them to send an ambulance, or get to a place that had cell phone service.  He got cell phone service when he was on a nearby street (Shady Glen).  He called for an ambulance. He then called the house, but he didn't know if anyone was home. Alexander's dad was there. He told the dad what happened. The dad hung up on him. He didn't go back because the ambulance was on its way.
He hasn't been doing drugs with Alexander.  He didn't brings drugs to Alexander. 
He takes Oxycotin sometimes. He gets the Oxycotin from a friend who gets it from a pharmacy. He didn't share his Oxycotin with Alexander.
He last saw Alexander alive on Sunday, 03/07/2021. 
He last talked to him today, Tuesday, 03/09/2021 at 7:30 pm.
He's seen Alexander maybe twice in the past 2 years. 
I asked Kastner to point out his vehicle which he did.  I looked into the vehicle and saw in the driver seat a hypodermic needle with an orange cover on it. I asked Kastner about it and he told me he uses the needle to take his stomach medication.
The Coroner’s Office performed an autopsy on Alexander Amiri on 03/10/2021.  Nothing had been determined at the autopsy and his blood was sent to the toxicology department for analysis.  The cause and manner of death remain pending. 
On 03/17/2021, I spoke to Alexander Amiri’s girlfriend, Nicole Boston, who told me the following (organized, summarized and paraphrased):
Alexander had a friend named Ryan who is a ""drug head"". Ryan had some good jobs and he lost them all due to the drugs. He kept popping pills. Alexander has recently been with Ryan  all the time. She told Alexander that she was done with him if he stayed with Ryan. He told her that he wouldn't be with Ryan. 
This past week, maybe the end of February, Alexander told her ""You'll never guess who came to my house."" She asked him who came to his house and he told her Ryan. She was upset. Alexander told her Ryan just stopped by. She believed Alexander was lying to her. Alexander eventually told her that he called Ryan because Ryan was his friend. She asked Alexander why he was hanging with Ryan when he is a ""dope head"". 
Ryan coerces Alexander to take stuff, or Ryan gives Alexander stuff. Alexander told her Ryan didn't do that.
She was with Alexander Saturday night into Sunday. She had to leave Sunday afternoon around 3:00 pm to check on her mom. Alexander told her that they were going to get married and move into a house. Alexander was not on drugs at that time. 
Alexander's dad, Hamid, called her Sunday night telling her that Alexander was getting ready to go out with someone. Hamid asked her if she knew who he was going out with. She told him no and called Alexander and asked him who he was going out with. Alexander told her he wasn't going out with anybody. Eventually, Alexander told her he was meeting someone and he was with Ryan. She told him that if he went out with Ryan then that was it, she was done with him. Alexander said okay, everything is over and hung up. 
She last talked to Alexander on Sunday night. Alexander was with Ryan on that night. 
She knows that Alexander was hanging with Ryan. He died because of Ryan. 
She doesn't know what Ryan deals in, but one of their friends, Stephen Lowe, died last year from an overdose. Lowe was taking heroin and all kinds of pills.  Ryan is known to be the guy who has drugs.  Ryan does drugs; he does pills; he smokes weed. She has seen Ryan with a bag that has needles in it and pills. She has known Ryan for about 8 years. 
When Alexander started to hang with Ryan she knew something bad would happen. She thought he would end up in jail, she didn't think he would die.
Alexander never told her that he was taking drugs. 
She knew Alex was hanging with Ryan because Alex started lying about what he was doing. This was about a week prior to his death. Whenever Ryan was around Alexander, Alexander would be taking drugs, either that day or the next. 
Alexander did not have a strong will power. 
Based on my investigation of Alexander Amiri’s death, I believe it is suspicious, because he had no obvious signs of the cause of death; he had not had any recent medical problems; Ryan Kastner was probably the last person to see Alexander alive; Kastner is known to be a drug dealer and has used drugs with Alexander in the past; and Kastner left the scene after Alexander collapsed in the driveway.
The Coroner’s Office reported that the autopsy did not reveal anything significant and that Alexander’s blood was being sent to the toxicology department for analysis. The cause and manner of death remain pending. 
Based on my training, education and experience, and the aforementioned, I believe Alexander was using illegal narcotics, possibly given to him by Kastner. I believe that the illegal narcotics that Alexander was using caused, influenced or contributed to his death.  
Based on my training, education and experience, and the aforementioned, I believe Alexander communicated with Kastner by means of electronic communication and by use of his cell phone; and that the communication facilitated the transfer or acquisition of the illegal narcotics that caused, influenced or contributed to Alexander’s death.
Based on my training, education and experience, I know that subjects who use illegal narcotics will sometimes search the Internet to educate themselves on ways and combinations of taking/consuming illegal narcotics to increase the effects of narcotics, as well as to educate themselves on how narcotics interact with each other, positively and/or negatively. 
Based on my training, education and experience, I know that electronic devices, such as cell phones have digital media storage locations within the electronic device, that those storage locations can store large amounts of data, including photos, videos, recordings, writings or other digital media. I know that cell phones have “traditional” storage folders or files that are named such, such as “photos”, “videos”, “messages”, “notes”, “contacts”, and “mail”. However, I also know that cell phones have “non-traditional” storage locations that are not named such, such as applications that have or could be installed on cell phones related to games and social media. I know that some storage locations are outside the cell phone device themselves, where the cell phone has settings that automatically send or upload the data to the alternative storage location, or cell phone user manually sends the data to the storage location electronically, sometimes through text or email communication, or through the electronic “cloud”.
Based on my training, education and experience, I know that when individuals use an electronic device, such as cell phones to communicate with others, whether it be by phone call, text message, instant message, email, voicemail, Internet applications such as Instagram, or other modes of communication, and that evidence or data for the communication is stored and maintained on the electronic device used to send the communication; and that even if the individual “deletes” such communication, the deleted items may still be contained in a data storage location on the cell phone, such as in folders labeled “trash” or “recycle bin”, and/or in other locations within the cell phone.
Based on my training, education and experience, I know that when an individual creates any form of digital media, such as photos, videos, recordings, writings or other items, that evidence or data of the digital media is stored and maintained on the electronic device, such as cell phones used to view or create such digital media; and that even if the individual “deletes” such digital media, the deleted items may still be contained in a data storage location on the device, such as in folders labeled “trash” or “recycle bin”, and/or in other locations within the device.
Based on my training, education and experience, I know that electronic devices, such as cell phones have applications installed on the electronic device that would allow the user, through the device itself, to access, communicate with, and/or search Internet websites for the purposes of obtaining information about a particular subject matter, place or person; to communicate with other subjects or entities; and to share or exchange data such as photos, videos, recordings, writings, messages, etc. with those other subjects or entities. I know that electronic devices store Internet search/browser history detail(s) and content, for the Internet locations that were search, visited and/or sought on the electronic device. 
Based on my training, education and experience, I know that cell phones store data, such as videos, photos, documents, writings, recordings, and other digital media, in the internal memory of the device, and/or on a removable storage device, such as a thumb drive, memory card, SIM card, etc. 
Based on my training, education and experience, I know that I and other Law Enforcement officers can search electronic devices, with or without the assistance of forensic tools, to discover, locate, obtain 
and memorialize the above mentioned items; and that those items will often have a “created date”, a “modified date”, and/or a “last accessed date”, for the individual item of data. 
Based on my training, education and experience, and the aforementioned, I believe that a search/examination/review of Alexander Amiri’s Apple iPhone IMEI: 354389066076893 would provide information and evidence as to Alexander’s actions, and communication with others (attempted and/or completed) prior to and during his death.  Such information and evidence would assist in determining the cause/manner of his death, whether it be by a homicide, a suicide, an accident, a natural event, or a medical issue.  Therefore, I request a search warrant that authorizes the search/examination/review of Alexander Amiri’s Apple iPhone IMEI: 354389066076893.

"Walnut Creek PD","Contra Costa"," ","04/07/2021 - 09:42","On 02/20/2020 officers were dispatched to Motel 6, Walnut Creek, California, for a report of a male and female in a fight. The female, Victim, was the reporting party. On the dispatch recording Victim claimed that the male, Ajuni Robinson, hit her and was her pimp.
Officers arrived on scene. Robinson had left prior to their arrival. Officers made contact with Victim and saw that she had a bloody nose, her top lip was swollen and she claimed that Robinson had hit her and ""choked"" her until she lost consciousness. Victim made statements that alluded to Robinson being her pimp, such as: he took all her money; he was supposed to protect her from her paying clients, but he wasn't doing his job; and he was taking the money she made from her work. She stated she was a prostitute and had regular clients. Robinson collected the money she made from her work and she did not have enough money to eat or to take care of herself. Victim wanted prosecution against Robinson.
Robinson was located a short distance away from Motel 6 and detained. He was later interviewed about what had happened and he told the officers that he and Victim had been dating for 9 months. He paid for a room at Motel 6 so they could spend time together. He denied hitting or ""choking"" Victim. When asked if he was Victim’s pimp he said Victim had mental health issues.
Robinson was arrested for domestic violence, pimping and false imprisonment.
The Motel 6 clerk advised that the room was registered to Robinson.
On 02/20/2020 I re-interviewed Victim who told me that she was a prostitute and she gives Robinson all her money. 
Robinson has a criminal history that include domestic violence and pimping.
On 04/17/2020 officers were dispatched to the Marriott Hotel in Walnut Creek, California for a report of a domestic assault. The female, Victim, claimed that Ajuni Robinson was her pimp. Victim had bruises on her neck and chest. Victim told the officers that Robinson had hit her and had pistol whipped her a few days prior. She told the officers that she was working for Robinson as a prostitute. She had been a prostitute since the age of 13 and wanted to stop.
Victim had ""Ajuni"" tattooed on her hip.
Robinson had paid for the room at the Marriott Hotel.
She was scared.
Robinson was not located.
On 04/18/2020 Walnut Creek officers re-interviewed Victim. Victim stated that she works for Robinson as a prostitute. She stated that Robinson takes all the money she makes from her clients. She has tried to leave Robinson but he physically assaults her. The bruising she had on 04/17/2020 was from Robinson hitting her the last time she tried to leave.
Victim wants to get help and did not want to continue her relationship with Robinson or continue being a prostitute.

"Walnut Creek PD","Contra Costa"," ","04/08/2021 - 13:20","On 03/05/2021, at about 1132 hours, Walnut Creek Police Department officers were dispatched to a residence in Walnut Creek, California for a report of a male, Gregory Londahl, who appeared to have passed away and was beyond medical help.  Upon arrival, officers saw that paramedics were already on scene.  Paramedics pronounced Londahl deceased.
Londahl's body was located in his bedroom at his residence.  His upper body was face down on his bed. His arms were bent beneath his body, with his hands up near his face, palms down. The lower half of his body was off the bed. His legs were bent at the knee, and his feet on the ground pointed to his right. Gregory was still fully clothed and wearing shoes.
Londahl's body had lividity and was in a state of rigor mortis. There were no obvious signs of trauma to Londahl's body.
Next to Londahl's body, on a stand, was a baggie that appeared to have methamphetamine in it.
Two cell phones were located in Londahl’s room which were seized as evidence by the officers. 
Officer Olson spoke to Christopher Londahl, Gregory’s brother, who told them the following in summary (organized and paraphrased):
His brother Gregory and Gregory’s daughter, Chelsea Londahl, live at the residence.  Christopher was on his was to their house to do some maintenance on their house. While driving to the house, Chelsea called him.  She sounded ""worried sick"" and ""traumatized"" on the phone and told him that  Gregory was dead. When he arrived at the residence, at approximately 1130 hours, Gregory was on the bed, pasty white and cold. Gregory was face down.
He was last at Gregory's residence yesterday (3/4/21) around 1600 hours. He has been coming by the house to help clean up. Gregory had been in ""rough shape"" for a while. Gregory's breathing was always somewhat labored. Gregory did not appear to be out of the ordinary yesterday.
He doesn’t know if Chelsea was at the residence last night. Chelsea left the residence this morning before he arrived because she thought she had warrants and did not want to be arrested.
He thinks Gregory's last doctor's visit was an emergency room visit, and he thinks it was in January 2021. Gregory came home from that visit with oxygen tanks and inhalers.  He has been diagnosed with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).  Gregory smokes methamphetamine.
END OF STATEMENT.
Christopher told the officers that he had cleaned Gregory’s room prior to their arrival because “it looked bad”.   He had placed the items he removed from Gregory’s room into a black, trash bag and put the trash bag in a car.  Christopher informed the officers he also removed a firearm from under Gregory's pillow because he did not want someone to find it and get hurt. Christopher placed the firearm in the black trash bag.  Officers looked into the trash bag and saw among other things, hypodermic needles and a homemade firearm.  There was no serial number on the firearm. 
Officer Olson called Chelsea Londahl, who told him the following in summary (organized and paraphrased):
Chelsea got up around 0300 hours or 0400 hours and changed the dressing on a cut on her father's hand. Her father seemed tired and kept falling asleep and waking up, but otherwise seemed normal. Her father told her he could not find his inhaler. She went back to bed. She got up around 1000 hours and went to see what her father was doing. When she checked on her father he was stiff and she could not wake him up or roll him over.
Her father was diagnosed having COPD. Her father was last at JMH three or four months ago. She thinks that visit was for an infection in her father's lung.
Her father was ""always"" using meth and fentanyl, and was using both last night. Her father would use frequently throughout the day and night. On average, she thinks her father used about a gram of methamphetamine and some fentanyl during the day. Nobody else was using drugs with her father yesterday.
Her father had one friend, Rodney, over at the house yesterday around 1700 hours. She does not know Rodney's last name and thinks Rodney is currently homeless. She does not have a phone number for Rodney. She thinks Rodney uses drugs as well.
She does not know how much methamphetamine or fentanyl is in the house right now. If there are any drugs in the house, they may be in her father's pockets or in her father's bedroom area.
She thinks her father was using Prednisone ""here and there."" He was not using it every day, but would get it from the emergency room or acquire them on his own. He did not take them frequently, but would take one or two pills a month. Her father was prescribed an Albuterol inhaler, an Albuterol nebulizer, and a Symbicort inhaler.
END OF STATEMENT.
The officers did not collect any of the suspected methamphetamine for evidence or testing due to the possibility of it containing fentanyl, which can be deadly. 
The Deputy Coroner arrived on scene and took possession of Londahl's body.  As of this time the Coroner’s report is not ready.  Londahl’s blood was sent to the toxicology department for analysis.  The cause and manner of death remain pending. 
Based on my investigation of Gregory Londahl’s death, I believe it is suspicious, due to the amount of drugs found near him; that his daughter Chelsea Londahl fled the house prior to police arrival; that his brother Christopher Londahl removed items from Gregory’s room prior to police arrival; and that Christopher found a gun under Gregory’s pillow. 
Based on my training, education and experience, and the aforementioned, I believe Londahl was using illegal narcotics. I believe that the illegal narcotics that Londahl was using caused, influenced or contributed to his death.  
Based on my training, education and experience, and the aforementioned, I believe Londahl communicated with a subject by means of electronic communication and by use of his cell phone; and that the communication facilitated the transfer or acquisition of the illegal narcotics that caused, influenced or contributed to Londahl’s death.
Based on my training, education and experience, and the aforementioned, I believe that a search/examination/review of Gregory Londahl’s two cell phone, the 1) black LG flip phone and 2) black Motorola cell phone, would provide information and evidence as to Londahl’s actions, and communication with others (attempted and/or completed) prior to and during his death.  Such information and evidence would assist in determining the cause/manner of his death, whether it be by a homicide, a suicide, an accident, a natural event, or a medical issue.  Therefore, I request a search warrant that authorizes the search/examination/review of Gregory Londahl’s two cell phones, the 1) black LG flip phone and 2) black Motorola cell phone.
