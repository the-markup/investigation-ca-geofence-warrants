Shortly after the robbery, the suspect used the victim's credit cards at a KFC located in Oakland. A Google Geo-Fence warrant was granted by a judge and executed to trace any cell data where the original crime occurred (First St and Grant Ave) and also at KFC in Oakland (3400 Foothill Blvd) in an attempt to locate the same device at both areas. In November, 2019 I received  Device ID information from Google which did not appear to be a match to the suspect.

",Yes,"Per 1524.2(b)(2) states, â€œIf the applicant makes a showing and the magistrate finds that failure to produce records within less than five business days would cause an adverse result, the warrant may require production of records within less than five business days. A court may reasonably extend the time required for production of the records upon finding that the foreign corporation has shown good cause for that extension and that an extension of time would not cause an adverse result.â€_x000D_
I believe this is applicable because the perpetrator in this incident has shown a propensity for random and unprovoked violence by shooting an unarmed female victim (no weapons on any kind were located in the vehicle, no witnesses have come forward claiming the victim was using any weapons or vehicle in a manner threatening human life.  No evidence of gang affiliation has been connected to the victim).  Every day this person(s) remains at large the thousands of motoring public traveling on bay area freeways remain at risk of another unprovoked attack.  Every day this person(s) remain at large, the likelihood evidence is hidden or destroyed increases.  Further, everyday this crime remains unsolved, the propensity for this and/or others to take part in freeway shootings increase as the notion that the freeway is a place these shootings can go without justice increases.   _x000D_
